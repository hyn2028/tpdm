# Improving 3D Imaging with Pre-Trained Perpendicular 2D Diffusion Models (TPDM)

This repository `TPDM` is the official implementation of the paper [Improving 3D Imaging with Pre-Trained Perpendicular 2D Diffusion Models (arxiv)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08440).

## Abstract
Proposed is a novel approach using two pre-trained 2D diffusion models perpendicular to each other to solve the 3D inverse problem effectively. Experimental results show its high effectiveness for 3D medical image reconstruction tasks, such as MRI Z-axis super-resolution, compressed sensing MRI, and sparse-view CT, generating high-quality voxel volumes for medical applications.

## News
- **2024.04.21** We now additionally release checkpoints and sample volumes for the `LDCT-CUBE` dataset.
- **2024.04.21** The code now supports modifying the hyperparameter K introduced in the paper. Previously, it was fixed at K=2.

## Getting started


###  1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hyn2028/tpdm.git
cd tpdm
```


### 2. Install dependencies

Here's a summary of the key dependencies.
- python 3.10
- pytorch 1.13.1
- CUDA 11.7

We highly recommend using [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) to install all of the dependencies.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```
To activate the environment, run:

```bash
conda activate tpdm
```


### 3. Download the pre-trained checkpoints
Download the pre-trained model for a 256x256x256 brain-MRI and abdominal-CT volume from the Google Drive link below. You can find detailed information about the dataset which we used in the paper.

| Dataset | Resolution | Model | Slice| Plane | Link |
|:-------:|:----------:|:-----:|:----:|:-----:|:----:|
| BMR-ZSR-1mm | 256 | primary model | coronal | YZ | [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n4-nV8SOG1OaZTt5DPo84NIiI_gglk3d/view?usp=sharing) |
| | | auxiliary model | axial | XY | [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17l_iulJsQDw9poUdZrHJY1CZH8x-G_YI/view?usp=sharing) |
| LDCT(AAPM)-CUBE | 256 | primary model | axial | XY | [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lYIAr6APDn-jSbMwG7YZI814Gifa4g_B/view?usp=sharing) | 
| | | auxiliary model | coronal | YZ | [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VwQdAy0FryBwhUGXdVf6yWuy-On__Lsr/view?usp=sharing) |

> The `LDCT-CUBE` checkpoint originated from an experiment to observe the behavior of TPDM when the ***dataset was extremely small*** (10 volumes) to train a 3D model. Therefore, its ***PERFORMANCE may be INSUFFICIENT*** for use in abdominal CT-related tasks.

After downloading the checkpoints, place them in the `./checkpoints` directory. The directory structure should look like this:
```
tpdm
├── checkpoints
│   ├── BMR_ZSR_256_XY
│   │   └── checkpoint.pth
│   ├── BMR_ZSR_256_YZ
│   │   └── checkpoint.pth
│   ├── AAPM_256_CUBE_SCLIP_XY
│   │   └── checkpoint.pth
│   └── AAPM_256_CUBE_SCLIP_YZ
│       └── checkpoint.pth
│   ...
```


### 4. Download sample volumes for testing
Download sample brain-MRI and abdominal-CT volumes from the Google Drive link below.

| Dataset | Resolution | Slice | Plane | Link | Source |
|:-------:|:----------:|:-----:|:-----:|:----:|:------:|
| BMR-ZSR-1mm | 256 |  coronal | YZ | [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14-NAWKVQigv4LhHUBqlwHZja0HpulEOs/view?usp=sharing) | **synthetic** |
| LDCT(AAPM)-CUBE | 256 | axial | XY | [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lSsWW0f1UQgLs1dugrylwj0K4D0-VfES/view?usp=sharing) | L067 volume from [link](https://ctcicblog.mayo.edu/2016-low-dose-ct-grand-challenge/)  |

> NOTE: This sample brain-MRI volume is ***NOT A REAL MRI VOLUME***. The pre-trained generative model generated it.

- Due to `BMR-ZSR` dataset restrictions, we are **unable to share the human subject test volumes** we used in our experiments, so we provide a volume generated by unconditional `TPDM` as a sample.
- The sample volume of `LDCT-CUBE` is the L067 volume processed from the *AAPM 2016 Low Dose CT Grand Challenge* dataset. The raw volume was converted to 256 cubes using the method mentioned in the paper. Afterwards, it was globally normalized such that the global signal (cube region only) ranged from -0.009425847 to 1.9688704.

After downloading sample volumes, place it in the `./dataset_sample` directory. The directory structure should look like this:
```
tpdm
├── dataset_sample
│   ├── BMR_256_synthetic_0
│   │   ├── 000.npy
│   │   ├── 000.png
│   │   ...
│   │   ├── 255.npy
│   │   └── 255.png
│   └── AAPM_256_CUBE_SCLIP_XY_L067
│       ├── 000.npy
│       ├── 000.png
│       ...
│       ├── 255.npy
│       └── 255.png
│   ...
```


### 5. Run `TPDM`

> NOTE: The ***RESULT*** using the ***SYNTHETIC SAMPLE*** volume may be ***MUCH HIGHER*** than the reported .

- Note that the paper evaluated using real human subject MRI volumes, so reconstructions using the sample volumes provided may result in much higher results than those reported in the paper.

You can see the various arguments for all executables as shown below. There are many more arguments than the ones shown in the example.  Additional arguments allow you to adjust the various hyperparameters such as the problem-related factor, DPS weight, and K.

```bash
python run_tpdm_uncond.py --help
python run_tpdm_mrzsr.py --help
python run_tpdm_csmri.py --help
python run_tpdm_svct.py --help
```

Please don't rely on automatic DPS weights, as the optimal DPS weight can vary depending on the type of problem, parameters of the problem, measurements, and batch size. This is for reference only.

#### 5.1. Unconditional volume generation
To generate a 256x256x256 brain-MRI volume with `TPDM`, run the following command:
```bash
python run_tpdm_uncond.py --batch-size <batch-size>
```


#### 5.2. MRI Z-axis super-resolution (MR-ZSR)
To perform MR-ZSR on a sample volume with `TPDM`, run the following command:
```bash
python run_tpdm_mrzsr.py ./dataset_sample/BMR_256_synthetic_0 --batch-size <batch-size>
```


#### 5.3. Compressed sensing MRI (CS-MRI)
To perform CS-MRI on a sample volume with `TPDM`, run the following command:
```bash
python run_tpdm_csmri.py ./dataset_sample/BMR_256_synthetic_0 --batch-size <batch-size>
```


#### 5.4. Sparse-view CT (SV-CT)
To perform SV-CT on a sample volume with `TPDM`, run the following command:
```bash
python run_tpdm_svct.py ./dataset_sample/AAPM_256_CUBE_SCLIP_XY_L067 --batch-size <batch-size>
```



## Traning your own model
Our models were trained independently of the TPDM sampling procedure using [score-SDE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13456). Use the [repository](https://github.com/yang-song/score_sde) to train the two perpendicular diffusion models. Please refer to that repository for usage of that training code.

> NOTE: `TPDM`'s sampling code is only implemented for variance-exploding SDE (VE-SDE).

See the `./configs/default_lsun_configs.py` and `./configs/ve/BMR_ZSR_256.py` for the configurations we used to train `score-SDE` model.
